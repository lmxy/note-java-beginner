In the last video, I told you that get method is a blocking method, when we call it , the current thread has to wait until the result of this task is ready. So, even though you're executing this task in a seperate thread, we're making the current thread wait for the completion of that thread. We are not using our thread properly, we are wasting our thread. Then, this is a very simple application. This is a commandment application. But if you had a mobile or desktop app, this main thread would be responsible for handling the UI events such as mouse clicks and keystrokes. So, if we make the main thread wait for the completion of another thread, it's not going to be able to respond to UI events, that application will gone to freeze, and the user is not going to be able to resize or move it. So, to get the most out of our threads, we should write code in a non blocking way. And that is what we call asynchronous program.
